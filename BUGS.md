This is a list of known issues and possible improvements for the future.

Bugs:
* Thin wall at rear of lower XY with Type 2

Improvements:
* Generally, enable a stronger gantry when freestanding
* Add hole on the side of the ABs to connect to the vertical extrusions
* Add option for heatsets or nuts, vs larger-size formed threads
* Slightly improve elbow thickness of XYs and suitability for plates by changing the Y positioning of the `ab_exposed_bearing_y_spacing` to be somewhat higher.
* Reposition rear extrusion to enable a large contiguous space for cables, bowden, or more?
* Consider vertical motion for tensioners
